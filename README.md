# House_Sales_King_County
Analyzed the sales of more than 21000 houses in King County over a period of 1 year.

Data Wrangling was done to handle missing values and some features were visualized using Boxplot and Regression plot for exploratory data analysis to find correlation between different features and to also find the outliers.

Linear Regression model was developed and trained on selected features. Pipelining was used with Standard Scaler and Polynomial Features along with the model.

Ridge Regression model was developed and trained with regularization parameter set to avoid overfitting. Second order polynomial transform was used on both training and testing data.
